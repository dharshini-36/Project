		<b>Overview: </b>Shershah --- Overview<br>
This biographical war drama follows the heroic journey of Captain Vikram Batra, as narrated by his twin brother, Vishal Batra, in a TED Talk.
From a fearless childhood to his dream of joining the Indian Army, Vikram's journey unfolds through college, love, and his decision to serve the nation. Commissioned into the 13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, he earns respect among his men and bravely fights insurgents in Sopore.
During the Kargil War, Vikram leads his troops in capturing Point 5140 and later embarks on the crucial mission to reclaim Point 4875. Despite heavy fire, he heroically rescues a fellow soldier but is fatally shot. His last words—"Yeh Dil Maange More"—symbolize his undying spirit.
Posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, Vikram’s legacy endures, inspiring generations. The film closes with his funeral and a grieving Dimple, as real footage of Vikram Batra honors his sacrifice.<br><br>
