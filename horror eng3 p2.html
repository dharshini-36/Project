In Santa Monica, medical student John gifts his pregnant wife Mia a vintage porcelain doll. That night, their neighbors are murdered by their cult-member daughter Annabelle and her boyfriend, who then attack the Forms. The police kill the man, while Annabelle takes her own life, clutching the doll.After a series of eerie events, Mia gives birth to their daughter, Leah, and the family moves to Pasadena—only for the strange occurrences to continue. Learning that the cult summoned a demon to claim a soul, Mia seeks help from Father Perez. When he tries to take the doll to the Warrens, the demon attacks him and later abducts Leah, demanding Mia’s soul.
As Mia prepares to sacrifice herself, their neighbor Evelyn takes her place as atonement for her past. The demon vanishes, leaving Leah unharmed. Months later, the doll reappears in an antique shop, eventually finding its way to the Warrens’ artifact room.<br><br>
