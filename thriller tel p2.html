		<b>Overview: </b>Lucky Baskar -- Overview

Set in 1992 Bombay, the film follows Baskhar Kumar, a modest bank cashier who gets entangled in financial fraud, leading to his eventual downfall and redemption. Initially struggling with debts and a stagnant career, Baskhar resorts to smuggling and stock market manipulation to amass wealth. His success strains his family relationships, particularly with his wife Sumathi, who disapproves of his dishonest methods.
As he climbs the ranks in Magadha Bank, he becomes involved with businessman Harsha Mehra's fraudulent financial schemes. However, after witnessing the devastating consequences of unchecked greed—including the death of a bank manager—Baskhar attempts to expose the corruption. His efforts put him at odds with the bank’s higher-ups, who frame him for their own crimes.
In a final act of defiance, Baskhar outsmarts his corrupt superiors, triggering an investigation that dismantles the entire financial empire. Having secured an escape plan in advance, he and his family flee to America, where they start anew with a luxurious life, free from their past mistakes.<br><br>
