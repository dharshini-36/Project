		<b>Overview: </b>Amaran --- Overview<br>
This biographical drama follows the life of Major Mukund Varadarajan through the eyes of his wife, Indhu Rebecca Varghese. As she travels to New Delhi to receive the Ashoka Chakra posthumously awarded to Mukund, she reminisces about their love story—from college romance to his journey in the Indian Army.
Mukund’s rise through the ranks leads him to Kashmir, where he fearlessly hunts down terrorists like Altaf Baba and Asif Wani. His final mission proves fatal as he eliminates Wani but succumbs to his injuries. Despite her grief, Indhu stays strong, honoring her promise to him.
The film ends with Indhu receiving the Ashoka Chakra and a bust of Mukund being unveiled at the Officers Training Academy, symbolizing his legacy of bravery and sacrifice..<br><br>
