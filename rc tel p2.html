		<b>Overview: </b>Hi Nanna--- Overview<br>
Six-year-old Mahi, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, lives with her single father, Viraj, in Mumbai. Curious about her missing mother, she runs away and meets Yashna, who unknowingly helps uncover Viraj's hidden past. At Mahi’s insistence, Viraj recounts his love story with "Varsha," revealing how they married, had Mahi, and tragically separated after an accident that erased Varsha’s memory.
In a shocking twist, Yashna is revealed to be Varsha, suffering from amnesia. Viraj had kept her identity a secret, believing it was best for her. As Yashna reconnects with Mahi, she rediscovers her love for Viraj. However, when the truth is revealed, Mahi rejects her, feeling betrayed. Soon after, Mahi suffers a respiratory failure. Yashna, now aware of her past, rushes to the hospital with her fiancé, Dr. Aravind, who helps save Mahi’s life.
As Yashna and Viraj support each other, she unknowingly expresses a wish to be Mahi’s real mother—proving their love was always destined. The film ends with a grown-up Mahi performing a song taught by her mother, symbolizing their heartfelt reunion.
