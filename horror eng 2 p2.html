		<b>Overview: </b>The Conjuring (2013) -- Overview<br>
This supernatural horror film follows renowned demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren as they investigate a terrifying case in 1971.
Roger and Carolyn Perron move into a secluded farmhouse with their five daughters, only to experience disturbing paranormal activity. Mysterious bruises, a dead pet, and sinister spirits lead Carolyn to seek help from the Warrens. Lorraine discovers that the land is cursed by Bathsheba Sherman, a witch who sacrificed her child and cursed all future inhabitants.
As the hauntings escalate, Bathsheba possesses Carolyn, forcing her to attempt to kill her daughters. In a desperate battle, Ed performs an exorcism while Lorraine connects with Carolyn through a cherished memory, ultimately banishing Bathsheba. The film ends with the Warrens adding another haunted artifact—the Perrons’ music box—to their collection.<br><br>
