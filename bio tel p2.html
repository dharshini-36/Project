<p><b>Movie Name:</b>Mahanati 2018 <br><br>
        <b>Director: </b> Nag Ashwin <br><br>
		<b>Overview: </b>Mahanati--- Overview<br>
This biographical drama follows the life of legendary actress Savitri, narrated through the eyes of journalist Madhuravani.
In 1980, Savitri is found unconscious and slips into a year-long coma, drawing media attention. Assigned to cover her story, Madhuravani delves into Savitriâ€™s past, uncovering her journey from a talented young dancer in Vijayawada to a celebrated actress in South Indian cinema.
Her rise to stardom is intertwined with her romance and secret marriage to actor Gemini Ganesan. Initially supportive, Ganesan grows resentful as Savitri's fame surpasses his. Betrayed by his infidelity, she turns to alcohol, leading to financial ruin, health issues, and estrangement from loved ones.
Determined to rebuild her life, she quits drinking, loses weight, and returns to acting in low-budget films. However, overwhelmed by her struggles, she relapses and falls into a coma. Madhuravani completes her memoir, and as Savitri passes away in December 1981, her legacy remains immortal.
In the final reveal, "Shankarayya" is not a person but a statue Savitri regarded as her father, symbolizing the emotional depth of her journey.<br><br>
