Siva, a cheerful and helpful young man, often gets involved in assisting others, even at the cost of his own family's disapproval. After helping his cousin elope, he is cast out by his family. Later, he mistakenly kidnaps Pooja, thinking he is aiding a friend's love marriage. Pooja, however, is grateful, as she was being forced into marriage by her greedy uncles.
Siva shelters Pooja at his home, eventually falling in love with her. When her uncles kidnap her back, he cleverly infiltrates their household by posing as an assistant to their auditor, Emotional Ekambaram. Using a scheme involving fake American billionaires, Siva tricks Poojaâ€™s uncles into changing their ways. Ultimately, with the approval of both families, Siva and Pooja happily marry.
